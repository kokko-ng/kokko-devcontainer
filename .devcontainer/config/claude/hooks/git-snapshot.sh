#!/usr/bin/env bash
# git-snapshot.sh — checkpoint uncommitted tracked changes into a real git object.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# rebase/reset/checkout/stash silently overwrite tracked files. Uncommitted work
# was never a git object, so there is no reflog entry, no dangling blob, and
# `git fsck` cannot find it. It is simply gone. That has destroyed hours of work
# on real projects, repeatedly.
#
# `git stash create` builds a commit from the current tracked changes WITHOUT
# touching the working tree, the index, or the stash ref. Pointing a ref at it
# makes the work a first-class git object that survives every destructive
# command. This runs before git commands and on every user turn, so the window
# in which work exists only in the working tree stays small.
#
# Untracked files are deliberately NOT captured: rebase/reset/checkout only ever
# touch tracked paths, so untracked work is not at risk from them. (`git clean`
# is the exception — guard-git.sh denies it.)
#
# Recover with:  git stash apply <ref>     (see: snaps)
